Analysis of Speech: It involves breaking down spoken language into its individual components to understand and extract linguistic information. This process includes tasks like identifying phonemes (distinct sound units), determining prosody (intonation, rhythm, and stress), recognizing words, and interpreting meaning from speech. Various techniques and technologies, such as spectrograms, acoustic analysis, and machine learning algorithms, are used to analyze and understand the properties and structures of spoken language.

Synthesis of Speech: It is the process of generating artificial speech from textual or phonetic input. It involves combining linguistic elements like phonemes, prosody, and other linguistic features to create human-like speech. Text-to-speech (TTS) systems and speech synthesis technologies use algorithms and models to convert written text or phonetic representations into audible speech output. These systems aim to produce natural and intelligible speech that mimics human speech patterns and nuances.
